# Investigating Tier branded Okai ES400B Batteries

An aquaintance recently aquired a bunch of decomissioned Tier scooter battery packs.
The scooters and packs in question seem to be from an Okai ES400B.
They came inside big extruded aluminim cases that had to be returned.
Said aquaintance quickly figured out how to use a table saw to cut the case open and extract the packs innards who are very well encased and sealed with hughe amounts of grey putty like suposedly silicon gel.
Some packs clearly had corrosion damage from liquid exposure on the outside as well as the connectors but thanks to the sealant, no internal damage was found.

Overall the packs are exceptionally well build and protected, usually leaving them completely unharmed.
But they are clearly not build or meant to be repaired, serviced or used further outside the scooter.
The biggest issue for further use is the lack of information and interfacing with the battery.
To be precise, the BMS has the output disabled with no currently known way to have it enabled.

Simplest way around this is to destro the pack and harvest it for its cells.

But this repository tries to address the lack of information and documentation.
